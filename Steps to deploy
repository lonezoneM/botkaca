Hoi boiss 

today will be showing you how to deploy Leech BOT on heroku

what is a leech bot ?

leech bot allows you to upload contents from internet including torrent to telegram

Things we need
 
TG API 
TG API HASH 
get them from https://my.telegram.org/auth (sign in with your account)
click api development tools create app with any name 
there you will have tg Api and api hash 

now we need to create bot also '
@botfather
bot token 

we can also set commands and DP
Bot Command
start - start bot
pass - enter password that required
help - this message
leech - leech link or magnet
cancel - cancel leeching
list - list on going leech
upload_as_doc - toggle upload anything as document
upload_as_zip - toggle upload anything as bundled zipfile
set_thumbnail - set custom video thumbail
reset_thumbnail - reset custom video thumbnail
set_tracker - set default tracker, sparated by newline



ALRIGHT OUR WORK WITH BOT IS DONE 
NOW LETS MAKE LEECH BOT 



Repo we will be using
https://github.com/Finitebottutu/botkaca

THIS REPO IS NOT MADE BY ME I JUST EDITED IT TO MAKE IT DEPLOYABLE

ONLY LEECH BOT THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED ON HEROKU OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO USE VPS

FORK THE REPO AND DO THIS MAKE SURE TO SIGNIN OR SIGNUP ON HEROKU


wait for it to be deployed 

dont skip the video or exit 
we have to edit in HEROKU also 
for future purposes too 

I HAVE ALREADY CONNECTED MY GITHUB TO SOME OTHER HEROKU ACCOUNT 

BUT YOU NEED TO CONNECT TO GITHUB AND ENABLE AUTOMATIC DEPLOYS 
AND DEPLOY FROM MASTER BRANCH 

LETS TRY DOWNLOADING SOMETHING

IF YOU WANT TO UPLOAD CONTENT FROM YOUR GDRIVE THEN MAKE USE OF INDEX 
I WILL GIVE LINK TO TUTORIAL OF HOW TO MAKE INDEX 

THANKU FOR WATCHING 

AND SPECIAL THANKS TO LUCIF3RHUN AND FEDEL ALI FOR HELPING ME OUT PEACE
